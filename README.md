# Smart Traffic Light System with Emergency and Pedestrian Switch

This Arduino-based project simulates a smart traffic light control system using slide switches for emergency and pedestrian requests. The system is tested in Tinkercad.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- North-South (Road A) and East-West (Road B) traffic lights
- Emergency override switch (stops traffic and prioritizes Road A)
- Pedestrian switch (temporarily halts all traffic for safe crossing)
- Red, yellow, and green LEDs for both roads
- Fully compatible with Tinkercad simulation

## ðŸš¦ Components Used
- 6 LEDs (2 red, 2 yellow, 2 green)
- 2 Slide switches (for emergency and pedestrian modes)
- Arduino UNO
- Jumper wires
- (Optional) Breadboard

## ðŸ“· Tinkercad Setup

## ðŸ§  Code Logic
- If **emergency switch** is ON, override all signals and allow Road A to pass.
- If **pedestrian switch** is ON, turn all lights red for 2 seconds.
- Otherwise, loop the normal traffic signal cycle (Green â†’ Yellow â†’ Red) for each road.

## âœ… How to Use
1. Open `traffic_light.ino` in Arduino IDE or Tinkercad.
2. Set up the components based on the schematic or screenshot.
3. Use slide switches to simulate events.
4. Upload or simulate to test.
